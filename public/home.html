      <h2>Message from developer about website.</h2>
      <p>ohmydawg.co.uk is currently under development, changes
        will be made frequently and possibly without warning at this current time.
        At this current stage you can not directly edit/delete the dogsâ€™ details/photos. To do this you need to email
        me directly at ohmydawg.website@gmail.com and when I'm able to I will make requested changes. Also if you have
        any ideas to contribute to ohmydawg don't hesitate to email. Currently you need to create a new username with
        each new dog, this will be fixed and when it is I'll email you asking what your preferred username is.
      </p>
      <h3>Future plans for ohmydawg</h3>
      <div> 
        <li>Each dog to vote on each others profile </li>
        <li>To have a gallery of photos for each dog (each photo has individual tally of votes which is added together for main profile)</li>
        <li>Each dog has their profile page displaying details of themselves along with photos</li>
        <li>Each dog can delete their own photos and change their details</li>
        <li>Possibly dogs message each other to plan walks</li>
        <li>More than one dog under one username</li>
        <li>Revision of font used</li>
        <li>Include email within signup form</li>
