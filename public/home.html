      <h2>Message from developer about website.</h2>
      <p>ohmydawg.co.uk is currently under development, updates
        will be made frequently and possibly without warning at this current time.
        At this current stage you can not directly edit/delete the dogsâ€™ details/photos. To do this you need to email
        me directly at ohmydawg.website@gmail.com and when I'm able to I will make requested changes. Also if you have
        any ideas to contribute to ohmydawg don't hesitate to email. Currently you need to create a new username with
        each new dog, if you enter your email when I've updated the site I'll email you asking what your preferred username is. There are a few bugs which i 
        am sorting out, but if you come across any which aren't mentioned in list below please email to inform.
      </p>
      <h3>Future plans for ohmydawg</h3>

        <li>Each dog has their profile page displaying details of themselves along with photos</li>
        <li>Each dog can delete their own photos and change their details</li>
